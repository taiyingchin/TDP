                    <p>Red braised pork belly (红烧肉) is a classic pork dish originating from mainland China. Cooked using a combination of ginger, garlic, star anise, and a variety of other spices, red braised pork belly is both well known and eaten often around the family dining table during holidays.</p>
                    <p>When cooked properly, the fat and skin of the pork belly are soft and gelatinous, providing an easy melt in your mouth texture. Typically served with steamed rice and dark green vegetables in a restaurant setting, however often served with hard boiled eggs or carrots, potatoes, and daikon around the home table.</p>
                    <p>There are many variants of red braised pork belly depending on province. A popular style is from Huanese, called Chairman Mao’s Red Braised Pork Belly (毛氏红烧肉) is served at many Hunan restaurants across China, specializing in “Mao-style cuisine”.</p>

                    Cooking notes:<br><br>

                    Pork belly: you can purchase skin or or skin off pork belly, the resulting dish doesn’t vary too much with the skin on or off. Out of preference, I typically purchase skin on pork belly that is slightly on the leaner side which leads to a less oily dish. Costco sells pretty nice cuts of pork belly, otherwise you can typically find it at any Asian grocery store.

                    Pork belly is going to shrink when you cook it, so make sure you are cutting it into 1’’ (2.5cm) or 1.5’’ (3.8cm) pieces. Just cut against the grain of the meat, which will result in long rectangular pieces of pork. Leave the meat attached to the fat which will help the meat braise and be more tender.<br><br>

                    Soy Sauce: while having both light and dark soy sauce promotes a very rich, savory, umami taste, it isn’t necessary if you are not able to find dark soy sauce around you. Regular (light) soy sauce will provide the same amount of taste, just not as heavily.<br><br>

                    Sugar: brown or white sugar doesn’t really matter. The sugar is just going to be melted down in a pan and then coated onto the pork belly for a glazed texture. Traditionally, I use rock sugar (冰糖) which is a little more mild than granulated sugar and is a little more flexible in cooking.<br><br>

                    Vegetables: You can make this dish without the carrots, potatoes, daikon, or eggs if you would like. I like to make this into more of a stew than just glazed pork belly.

                <article>
                    <p>Prior to cooking the pork, you need to blanch the meat. Blanching just means cooking the meat in water with aromatics which will do two things: 1. Infuses the flavor of the aromatics and 2. Cooks out the impurities of the meat to provide better flavor in the finished dish.</p>
                    <p>All you need to do is put the pork belly in a pot, cover with cold water, and throw in the 1’’ of ginger sliced along with 2 whole green onions cut into 2’’ pieces. Bring water to a boil, and set to a medium simmer while skimming impurities off the top of the liquid. Once you have skimmed off most of the foam, reserve one cup of the cooking liquid, and rinse the cooked pork belly under cold water. Make sure that you use a paper towel to pat down the meat once you are done rinsing, you don’t want any excess water to help prevent splatter when cooking the pork in hot sugar later on.</p>

                    Cooking Notes:<br><br>

                    Skimming: While it isn’t necessary to skim the impurities off the top while you are blanching the meat, this makes it easier to reserve the liquid later on without incorporating the impurities that you cooked out. If you want, you can also skip the skimming and use a fine mesh strainer to strain out a cup of the cooking liquid.<br><br>

                    Cold water: Running the cooked pork belly under cold water after cooking does two things. The first is that it shocks the meat so that it stops cooking from the residual heat of the meat and steam. The second thing is that it helps to wash off any impurities that stuck to the pork belly during the cooking process.

                    <p>The next step of the process is to caramelize the pork belly with a mixture of sugar and oil. This sounds like a difficult task, but it is relatively easy to do.</p>
                    <p>Grab a dry pan and pour in the sugar and some oil. Once the sugar has melted and incorporated with the oil, it will turn a nice amber color. That is when you want to add the pork belly into the concoction and brown the outsides of the pork belly.</p>

                    Cooking Notes:<br><br>

                    Depending on the size of the pan and how much pork you are cooking, you might need to split this step into batches in order to get a thorough caramelization on all sides of the pork belly.

                    <p>This is by far the easiest step. Just take the pork belly, and the rest of the ingredients and dump them into a large pot. </p>
                    <p>Once reached a boil, drop the heat down until a gentle simmer and braise the meat until the majority of the liquid is gone and you are left with a thick glossy sauce. At this point your pork should be tender and be very easy to pull apart as well.</p>

                    Cooking Notes:<br><br>

                    While this version reduces the sauce down until it is thick and rich, you are able to have a more stew like finished product if you start cooking with more liquid. Personally, I add chicken broth or vegetable broth to help keep the moisture and retain some of that soup like taste.

                    When you are doing this method with more broth, make sure you check the meat more often. There are times where I let it cook too long and the pork toughened up and was not as melt in your mouth as I would have liked.

                    <p>This dish is a very rich dish. When serving, make sure that you have other elements in your meal to help balance the taste. A very common way to serve is with leafy vegetables and steamed white rice. However, there are a wide variety of ways to serve this dish and don’t feel limited by my suggestion here.</p>

                    Serving Suggestions:<br><br>

                    While leafy vegetables and steamed white rice is the classic way to serve this dish, there are a wide variety of ways you can try. I personally take some pieces of meat and serve it over noodles or with potatoes when I don’t want to eat rice for lunch/dinner.

                    I have also seen some people just eat the dish as is and served in very small portions in order not to get overloaded with flavor. The rest of the dish can be portioned out and refrigerated for later if you are trying to meal prep.
